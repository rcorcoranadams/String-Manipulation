# String Manipulation with Weather Data

Version of Python: 2.7.5

- These scripts are broken into three parts:
  1. The first script writes a function that capitalizes the first and fourth letters of a name.
  2. The second script produces the output below using string manipulation techniques:
    Tonight: Clear, Low: 55 F
    Thursday: Sunny then Chance Showers, High: 77 F
    Friday: Sunny, High: 73 F
    Saturday: Mostly Sunny, High: 77 F
    Sunday: Mostly Sunny, High: 71 F
  3. The third script extracts the latitude and longitude from the URL: https://www.google.com/maps/@42.2509428,-71.8249939,17z
  The output is a text that reads:
    Latitude: 42.2509428
    Longitude: -71.8249939
- An error that I encountered was in the second exercise, my outputs were tripling. 
- With help from Shashank, I realized that I copy and pasted the lab exercise incorrectly. I also was using multiple for loops.
